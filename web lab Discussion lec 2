1. Which single or double quotes are preferred by PHP developers and why?
There is no definitive answer to which quotes are preferred by PHP developers, as both single and double quotes have their own advantages and disadvantages. However:

Use single quotes when you want to define a simple string that does not contain any variables or escape sequences. Single quotes are faster and more straightforward than double quotes.

Use double quotes when you want to interpolate variables or use escape sequences such as \n or \t in your string. Double quotes are more flexible and expressive than single quotes.

3. Write a script to include a web page called page1 in another web page called  
page2 use include and require, explain the deference between them and  
discuss what is the useful from using the include files?.
To include a web page called page1 in another web page called page2,  Can use either the include or the require statement in PHP. The syntax is:

<?php
// Using include
include 'page1.php';

// Using require
require 'page1.php'; 
?>

The difference between include and require is that if the file to be included is not found, include will only generate a warning and continue the script execution, while require will generate a fatal error and stop the script execution. Therefore, you should use require when the file is essential for the application, and use include when the file is not required and the application can still run without it.

The benefit of using include files is that they allow you to reuse the same code in multiple pages, such as headers, footers, menus, etc. This makes your code more modular, maintainable, and consistent.  can also use include files to define variables, functions, or classes that can be accessed from other pages. can read more about include and require in PHP from these sources.
