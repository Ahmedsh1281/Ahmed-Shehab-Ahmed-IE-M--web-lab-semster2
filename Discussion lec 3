1. What are the differences between global keyword and $GLOBALS?
The global keyword in PHP is used to access a global variable inside a function, while $GLOBALS is an array that stores all global variables and can be accessed from anywhere in the script.

2. Can you write a global keyword in a program with capital letters instead  
small? If your answer is: yes or no, why?
Yes, you can write PHP keywords in uppercase, lowercase, or any combination thereof. PHP keywords are case-insensitive, which means they function the same way regardless of how you capitalize them. For example, global, GLOBAL, and GlObAl are all valid and interpreted the same by the PHP interpreter.

3. Write a PHP script to enter 5 countries with their capital cities in an array and  
print out in descending order.
<?php
$countries = [
    'France' => 'Paris',
    'Germany' => 'Berlin',
    'Italy' => 'Rome',
    'Spain' => 'Madrid',
    'Portugal' => 'Lisbon'
];

// Sort the countries in descending order by key (country name)
krsort($countries);

// Print out the countries and their capitals
foreach ($countries as $country => $capital) {
    echo $country . ' - ' . $capital . '<br>';
}
?>
